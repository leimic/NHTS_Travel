  <h1>NHTS 2022 Mode Share Visualizations</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    These interactive visuals explore travel behavior in the U.S. using the 2022 National Household Travel Survey.
    They show how household vehicle access, income, urban/rural status, age, gender, and trip purpose influence transportation mode choice.
  </p>
  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="mode_share_by_vehicle_access.html">Mode Share by Vehicle Ownership</a></h2>
    <p>Shows how the presence of household vehicles influences transportation mode choice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="mode_share_by_vehicle_and_urbanicity.html">Mode Share by Vehicle Ownership and Urbanicity</a></h2>
    <p>Breaks down mode share across urban vs rural households by vehicle access.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="mode_share_by_vehicle_and_income.html">Mode Share by Vehicle Ownership and Income</a></h2>
    <p>Examines how household income and vehicle ownership shape mode decisions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="mode_share_by_age.html">Mode Share by Age Group</a></h2>
    <p>Reveals how age groups vary in their transportation preferences.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="mode_share_by_gender.html">Mode Share by Gender</a></h2>
    <p>Compares gender differences in travel mode choices.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="mode_share_by_purpose.html">Mode Share by Trip Purpose</a></h2>
    <p>Analyzes how trip purposes (e.g., work, shopping) relate to mode choice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2><a href="walk_share_by_region.html">Walk Share by Census Division</a></h2>

    <h3>About and Methods</h3>
    <p>
      These visualizations were created using Python (Pandas, Plotly) to analyze public microdata from the 
      <a href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/">2022 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dataset includes detailed trip records linked to household and individual-level attributes such as 
      income, age, gender, vehicle access, and location. Exploratory analysis and cross-tabulation were used 
      to estimate the modal share of walking, biking, transit, and driving across demographic and regional groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some charts reflect multivariate relationships (e.g. vehicle ownership by income and region), while others 
      focus on descriptive insights such as trip purpose or age group behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project was built as part of a transportation behavior analysis portfolio.
